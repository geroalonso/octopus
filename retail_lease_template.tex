    \begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|  }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Base Rent Schedule} \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Year 1 & \$1,000 plus tax \\
    Year 2 & \$1,000 plus tax \\

    In the event the Commencement Date is a day other than the first (1st) day of a month, the Rent will be prorated and paid in advance to the first (1st) of the following month, when Tenant will then, and on the first (1st) day of each subsequent month during the Term of the Lease, pay the monthly Rent in advance.

    In addition to Base Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord each month a sum equal to any sales tax, tax on rentals, and any other charges, taxes and/or impositions now in existence or hereafter imposed based upon the privilege of renting the space leased hereunder or upon the amount of rentals collected therefore.

        \item \label{Subsection 3A}In addition to the Base Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as ``Additional Rent'' a sum for Common Area Maintenance (CAM), Operating Expenses, and Taxes.   As used herein the term:

         \begin{enumerate}[I]
         \item Common Area Maintenance (``CAM'') shall be all inclusive, (property taxes are an obligation of the Tenant and will be billed separately from the CAM) and shall include the Operating Expenses as defined below.  Tenant’s initial CAM payment shall be \cam{} per square foot per year, payable monthly in addition to the Base Rent and shall increase annually as part of the Additional Rent. The minimum CAM charge during the term of the lease and continuing throughout the term of the Lease and/or any renewal options thereof is \cam{} per square foot.

        \item ``Operating Expenses'' shall mean all expenses, costs and disbursements, of every kind and nature which Landlord shall pay or become obligated to pay because of or in connection with the ownership, leasing, maintenance and/or operation of the Premises and Common Areas of the Plaza and land on which they are located, (which shall not include cost of individual tenant improvements, management or marketing cost associated with leasing activities). By way of explanation and clarification, but not by way of limitation, these Operating Expenses will include the following:

        
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Wages and salaries of all employees engaged in operation and maintenance of the Plaza, employer's social security taxes, unemployment taxes or insurance, and any other taxes which may be levied on such wages and salaries, the cost of disability and hospitalization insurance, pension or retirement benefits, and any other fringe benefits for such employees.

        \item Proportionate share of the cost of all utilities, including water, sewer, electricity, and gas attributed to the Plaza and not charged directly to another tenant.

        \item Proportionate share of repairs, line painting, depreciation on machinery and equipment used in the maintenance of the common area. 

         \item Landlord agrees to maintain accounting books and records reflecting Operating Expenses of the Premises in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  There mere mentioning of the lists of items above under Operating Expenses does not mean that all those services or items are provided or applicable.  It is merely a list of things that could be in Landlord’s expenses if Landlord so desires to include same, at Landlord’s sole discretion. Unless a service or item is expressly stated as being provided, it shall not be deemed provided, unless actually provided by Landlord.  The CAM fee shall be set at the rate stated above, irrespective of changes in the actual Landlord CAM.  The CAM shall increase each year if necessary, over the prior year’s CAM and shall be payable monthly in addition to the Base Rent.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item ``Taxes'' shall mean all impositions, taxes, assessments (special or otherwise), water and sewer charges and rents, and other governmental liens or charges of any and every kind, nature and sort whatsoever, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, and substitutes therefore, including all taxes whatsoever attributable in any manner to the Premises, the land on which the Premises is located, the ground leasehold interest of Landlord, or the rents (however the term may be defined) receivable therefrom or any part thereof, or any use thereof, or any facility located therein or thereon or used in conjunction therewith or any charge or other payment required to be paid to any governmental authority, whether or not any of the foregoing shall be designated ``property tax'', ``real estate tax'', ``sales tax'', ``rental tax'', ``excise tax'', ``business tax'', or designated in any other manner.

         \item Landlord shall notify Tenant within one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of each calendar year hereafter ensuing during the Term, of the amount which Landlord estimates (as evidenced by documents prepared by or on behalf of Landlord) will be the amount of Tenant's proportionate share of Taxes for the then current calendar year and Tenant shall pay such sum in advance to Landlord upon demand.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not delay or withhold payment of any balance shown to be due pursuant to a statement rendered by Landlord to Tenant, pursuant to the terms hereof, because of any objection which Tenant may raise with respect thereto.  Any over payment found to be owing to Tenant shall be refunded to Tenant within a reasonable time, presuming Tenant does not owe any other rent (or other sums) under the Lease.

         Each payment of Additional Rent shall be without any offset or deduction whatever, on or before the first day of the month, in lawful (legal tender for public or private debts) money of the United States of America, at \corpaddress{} or elsewhere as designated from time to time by Landlord's written notice to Tenant.

        In addition to Additional Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord each month a sum equal to any sales tax, tax on rentals, and any other charges, taxes and/or impositions now in existence or hereafter imposed based upon the privilege of renting the space leased hereunder or upon the amount of rentals collected therefor. Nothing herein shall, however, be taken to require Tenant to pay any part of any Federal and State Taxes on income imposed upon Landlord.

        \end{enumerate}
        \item Additional Rent due by reason of the provisions of subsection 3\ref{Subsection 3A} and this subsection 3B for the final months of this Lease is due and payable even though it may not be calculated until subsequent to the termination date of the Lease; the Taxes for the calendar year during which the Lease terminates shall be prorated according to that portion of said calendar year that this Lease was actually in effect. Tenant expressly agrees that Landlord, at Landlord's sole discretion, may apply the security deposit specified in Section \ref{Security Deposit} hereof, if any, in full or partial satisfaction of any Additional Rent due for the final month of this Lease by reason of the provisions of subsection 3\ref{Subsection 3A} and this subsection 3B. If said security deposit is greater than the amount of any such Additional Rent and there are no other sums or amounts owed Landlord by Tenant by reason of any other terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease, then Landlord shall refund the balance of said security deposit to Tenant as provided in Section \ref{Security Deposit}. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve Tenant, or imply that Tenant is relieved, of the liability for or the obligation to pay any Additional Rent due for the final month of this Lease by reason of the provisions of subsection 3A and this subsection 3B if said security deposit is less than such Additional Rent, nor shall Landlord be required to first apply said security deposit to such Additional Rent if there are any other sums or amounts owed Landlord by Tenant by reason of any other terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease.

        \item	Any reference in this Lease to ``Rent'' or ``rent'' includes Base Rent and Additional Rent.

        \item	Any and all payments due under this Lease shall be deemed as rent and shall be treated as such.

Landlord shall not be required to pay Tenant any interest on said Security Deposit and may commingle the Security Deposit with any of Landlord’s other money.

\section{Subordination}
    This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to any mortgage and/or ground lease now or hereafter encumbering the Plaza and/or the Premises. This provision shall be self-operative without the execution of any further instruments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant hereby agrees to execute any instrument(s) which Landlord may deem desirable to evidence the subordination of this Lease to any and all such mortgages and/or ground lease.

\section{Attornment}
    If the interests of Landlord under this Lease shall be transferred voluntarily or by reason of foreclosure or other proceedings for enforcement of any mortgage and/or ground lease on the Premises, Tenant shall be bound to such transferee (herein sometimes called the ``Purchaser'') for the remaining balance of the Term, and any extensions or renewals thereof which may be effective in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof with the same force and effect as if the Purchaser were Landlord under this Lease, and Tenant does hereby agree to attorn to the Purchaser, including the Mortgagee under any such mortgage and/or lessor under any such ground lease if it be the Purchaser, as its Landlord, said attornment to be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instruments upon the Purchaser succeeding to the interest of Landlord under this Lease. The respective rights and obligations of Tenant and the Purchaser upon such attornment, to the extent of the then remaining balance of the Term of this Lease and any such extensions and renewals, shall be and are the same as those set forth herein. In the event of such transfer of Landlord's interests, Landlord shall be released and relieved from all liability and responsibility thereafter accruing to Tenant under this Lease or otherwise and Landlord's successor by acceptance of rent from Tenant hereunder shall become liable and responsible to Tenant in respect in all obligations of the Landlord under this Lease.

\section{Assignment}
    Without the written consent of Landlord first obtained in each case, Tenant shall not sublease, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise encumber or dispose of this Lease or underlet the Premises or any part thereof or permit the Premises to be occupied by other persons. Any attempted assignment or sublease shall be void and considered a breach of this Lease by Tenant.  If approved by landlord, any assign, transfer, sublease, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise encumber or dispose of this lease will have an administrative charge of \$ 1,000.00 (One Thousand Dollars).

    For purposes of this Lease, assignment or subleasing shall include (a) if Tenant is a partnership, the withdrawal or change, voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, of a majority of the partners, or a transfer of a majority of partnership interests, within a twelve month period, or the dissolution of the partnership, and (b) if Tenant is a closely held corporation, the dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Tenant or within a twelve month period; (i) the sale or transfer of more than an aggregate of fifty percent (50\%) of the voting shares of Tenant (other than to immediate family members by reason of gift or death), or the (ii) sale, mortgage, hypothecation or pledge of more than an aggregate fifty percent (50\%) of Tenant's net assets.  If Tenant is a closely held corporation, Tenant represents that the ownership and power to vote its entire outstanding capital stock belongs to and is vested in the officer or officers executing this Lease or members of the immediate family thereof. 
    
\section{Successors and Assigns}
    All terms, provisions, covenants and conditions to be observed and performed by Tenant shall be applicable to and binding upon Tenant's respective heirs, administrators, executors, successors and assigns, subject, however, to the restrictions as to assignment or subletting by Tenant as provided herein. All expressed covenants of this Lease shall be deemed to be covenants running with the land.

\section{Hold Harmless of Landlord}
    In consideration of said Premises being leased to Tenant for the above rent, Tenant agrees that Tenant, at all times, shall indemnify and keep Landlord harmless from all losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, which may arise or be claimed against Landlord and be in favor of any persons, firms or corporations, consequent upon or arising from the use of occupancy of the Premises by Tenant, or consequent upon or arising from any acts, omissions, neglect or fault of Tenant, his agents, servants, employees, licensees, visitors, customers, patrons or invitees, or consequent upon or arising from Tenant's failure to comply with any laws, statutes, ordinances, codes or regulations as herein provided; that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages, losses or injuries to the persons or property of Tenant which may be caused by the acts, neglect, omissions or faults of any persons, firms or corporations, except when such injury, loss or damage results from gross negligence of Landlord, his agents or employees, and that Tenant will indemnify and keep harmless Landlord from all damages, liabilities, losses, injuries, or expenses which may arise or be claimed against Landlord and be in favor of any persons, firms or corporations, for any injuries or damages to the person or property of any persons, firms or corporations, where said injuries or damages arose about or upon said Premises as a result of the negligence of Tenant, its agents, employees, servants, licensees, visitors, customers, patrons, and invitees. All personal property placed or moved into the Premises or Plaza shall be at the risk of Tenant or the owner thereof, and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damage to said personal property. Tenant shall maintain at all times during the Term an insurance policy or policies in an amount or amounts sufficient, in Landlord's opinion, to indemnify Landlord or pay Landlord's damages, if any, resulting from any matters set forth in this section.

    In case Landlord shall be made a party to any litigation commenced against Tenant, then Tenant shall protect and hold Landlord harmless and shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred or paid by Landlord in connection with such litigation and any appeal thereof.  Landlord shall be entitled to select its own attorney and Tenant shall pay the Landlord’s legal fees and expenses.

\section{Attorney's Fees}
    If either party defaults in the performance of any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease and by reason thereof the other party employees the services of an attorney to enforce performance of the covenants, or to perform any service based upon defaults, then in any of said events the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and all expenses and costs incurred by the prevailing party pertaining thereto (including costs and fees relating to any appeal) and in enforcement of any remedy. Tenant shall be responsible to pay Landlord's attorneys' fees for enforcement of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, whether suit be brought or not.

\section{Damage or Destruction}
    In the event all or part of the Premises shall be destroyed or so damaged or injured by fire, windstorm, hurricane, natural disaster, or other casualty, during the Term, whereby the same shall be rendered untenantable, then Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to render such Premises tenantable by repairs within 180 days therefrom; Landlord shall have the further right within 90 days of the date of the damage, at its election, to cancel this Lease as to all or the untenantable portion of the Premises.  

    Landlord agrees that, within 90 days following damage or destruction, it shall notify Tenant with respect to whether or not Landlord intends to restore the Premises. If said Premises are not rendered tenantable within the aforesaid 180 days it shall be optional with either party hereto, no later than the date that Premises are in fact rendered tenantable, to cancel this Lease as to the tenantable portion, and in the event of such cancellation the rent shall be paid only to the date of such fire or casualty. The cancellation herein mentioned shall be evidenced in writing. During any time that all or a portion of the Premises are untenantable due to causes set forth in this Section, the Base Rent or a just and fair proportion thereof shall be abated.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) should damage or destruction occur during the last twelve months of the Term, either Landlord or Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease as to the untenantable portion of the Premises, effective on the date of damage or destruction, provided notice to terminate is given within 30 days of the date of such damage or destruction; (b) should damage, destruction or injury occur by reason of Tenant's negligence, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to render the Premises tenantable within 180 days of the date of damage, destruction or injury and no abatement of Rent shall occur and Tenant shall not have such option to terminate.

\section{Insurance}
    The Landlord assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever with respect to the conduct and operation of the business to be conducted in the Premises. The Landlord shall not be liable for any accident to or injury to any person or persons or property in or about the Premises or the Plaza which are caused by the conduct and operation of said business or by virtue of equipment or property of the Tenant in said Premises. The Tenant agrees to hold the Landlord harmless against all such claims.
    
    \begin{enumerate}

    \item	Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole expense, obtain and keep in force during the Term and any extension or renewal hereof: (i) fire and extended coverage insurance with vandalism and malicious mischief endorsements and a sprinkler leakage endorsement (where applicable), on all of its personal property, including removable trade fixtures, located in the Premises, and on all leasehold improvements and any future additions and improvements made by Tenant; and (ii) comprehensive general liability insurance, including contractual liability coverage, insuring Landlord (as an additional insured) and Tenant against any liability arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and all areas appurtenant thereto.

    \item	Said insurance shall be with insurance companies approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such companies shall be responsible insurance carriers authorized to issue the relevant insurance, authorized to do business in Florida and at least A-rated in the most current edition of BEST'S INSURANCE Reports. Comprehensive general liability insurance, including contractual liability coverage, shall have minimum limits of \propertyinsurance{} for any loss of or damage to property from any one accident, and \liabilityinsurance{} for death of or injury to any one person from any one accident. Fire and extended coverage insurance with vandalism and malicious mischief endorsements and a sprinkler leakage endorsement shall have limits not less than the replacement cost of all property (personal or otherwise) and capital improvements in the premises. The limits of said insurance shall not, however, limit the liability of the Tenant hereunder. The policies cannot contain provisions which deny coverage because the loss is due to the fault of Landlord or Tenant. If Tenant shall fail to procure and maintain said insurance, Landlord may, but shall not be required to, procure and maintain same, but at the expense of Tenant.  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, prior to occupancy of the Premises, copies of policies of liability insurance required herein, or certificates evidencing the existence and amounts of such insurance, with loss payable clauses satisfactory to Landlord. No policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage except after thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord shall have the right to review the Tenant's insurance once every year and to reasonably require Tenant to alter its insurance coverage to cover the effects of inflation and to include or eliminate certain provisions in the Tenant's insurance policy which reflect the then-current industry standards for this type of insurance coverage.
    \end{enumerate}


\section{Eminent Domain}
    If there shall be taken during the Term any part of the Premises, parking facilities or Plaza other than a part not interfering with maintenance, operations, or use of the Plaza, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease or to continue same in effect.  If Landlord elects to continue the Lease, the rent shall be reduced in proportion to the area of the Premises so taken and Landlord shall repair any damage to the Premises, resulting from such taking. If any part of the Premises is taken by condemnation or Eminent Domain which renders the Premises unsuitable for its intended use, the Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease, or if any part of the Premises is so taken which does not render the Premises unsuitable for its intended use, this Lease shall continue in effect and the rental shall be reduced in proportion to the area of the Premises so taken and Landlord shall repair any damage to the Premises resulting from such taking. If all of the Premises is taken by condemnation or Eminent Domain, this Lease shall terminate on the date of the taking. All sums awarded (or agreed upon between Landlord and the condemning authority) for the taking of the interest of Landlord and/or Tenant, whether as damages or as compensation, and whether for partial or total condemnation, will be the property of Landlord. If this Lease should be terminated under any provisions of this section, Rent shall be payable up to the date that possession is taken by the authority, and Landlord will refund to Tenant any prepaid unaccrued Rent less any sum or amount then owing by Tenant to Landlord.


\section{Abandonment}
    If, during the Term, Tenant shall abandon, vacate or remove from the Premises the major portion of the goods, wares, equipment or furnishings usually kept on said Premises, or shall cease doing business in the Premises, or shall suffer the rent to be in arrears, Landlord may, at its option, declare a default of this Lease and seek remedies in the manner stated herein, or Landlord may enter the Premises as the agent of Tenant by force or otherwise, without being liable in any way therefor and relet the Premises with or without any furniture that may be therein, as the agent of Tenant, at such price and upon such terms and for such duration of time as Landlord may determine, and receive the rent therefor, applying the same to the payment of Rent, and if the full Rent shall not be realized by Landlord over the expenses to Landlord of such reletting, Tenant shall pay any deficiency.
    

\section{Default}
    The occurrence of any of the following during the Term shall constitute an Event of Default by Tenant:
    \begin{enumerate}[(A)]

    \item Tenant shall fail to pay when due Base Rent, Additional Rent or any under charges that accrue under this Lease;

    \item Tenant shall fail to pay when due any other sums, fees, charges, costs, or expenses which are payable under this Lease;

    \item	Tenant shall, other than in the manner permitted under this Lease, make or permit or suffer to occur any assignment (including any transfer of interest in Tenant which is deemed to be an assignment under this Lease), sublease or occupancy arrangement, conveyance, transfer, conditional or collateral assignment, pledge, hypothecation, or other encumbrance, whether by operation of law or otherwise, of this Lease or any interest in this Lease;

    \item	Tenant shall fail in any other way in the performance or observance of any of the non-material terms and conditions of this Lease and within ten (10) days shall not have cured such default or, if impossible of cure within such time but possible of cure within sixty (60) days, begun and diligently pursued such cure to completion;

    \item	There shall be filed by or against Tenant or any Guarantor of this Lease in any court or other tribunal a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or for reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or substantially all of Tenant's, or any Guarantor's, property, unless such petition shall be filed against Tenant or any Guarantor of this Lease and Tenant or such Guarantor shall in good faith promptly thereafter commence and diligently prosecute any and all proceedings appropriate to secure the dismissal of such petition and shall secure such dismissal within thirty (30) days of its filing;

    \item	Tenant or any Guarantor of this Lease shall be adjudicated a bankrupt or an insolvent or take the benefit of any federal reorganization or composition proceeding, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or take the benefit of an insolvency law;

    \item	A trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver shall be appointed or elected or had for Tenant or any Guarantor of this Lease, whether under federal or state laws;

    \item	Tenant's interest under this Lease shall be sold under any execution or process of law;

    \item	The Premises shall be abandoned or deserted, or Tenant shall fail to make continuous use of the Premises for one (1) month for the Use; or

    \item	Tenant shall fail to maintain current, duly issued occupational licenses, or any other permit or license required by an applicable legal authority for its operations at the Premises or Tenant shall fail to meet the insurance requirements of this Lease and provide Certificates of Insurance (and policies if requested) evidencing such compliance.

    \item	Tenant shall fail to obey any terms of this Lease.
    
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Remedies}
    \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
    \item
    In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord, at Landlord's option, may elect to do one or more of the following:
    \begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item Accelerate all of the remaining Rent for the Term, in which event all Rent shall become immediately due and payable;

    \item Terminate this Lease as provided by this Section and re-enter the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises, either by summary proceedings or by any other suitable action or proceeding at law, or otherwise; or

    \item Without terminating this Lease, re-enter the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises, either by summary proceedings or by any other suitable action or proceeding at law, or otherwise, and relet all or any part of the Premises.

    \item  Keep any and all deposits held under this Lease as further damages.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease:
    \begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item Landlord shall give notice of such termination, which shall take effect ten (10) days after such notice is given, or such greater number of days as is set forth in such notice, fully and completely as if the effective date of such termination were the date originally set forth in this Lease for the expiration of the Term;

    \item Tenant shall quit and peacefully surrender the Premises to Landlord, without any payment by Landlord for doing so, on or before the effective date of termination; and

    \item All Rent, including all Base Rent and Additional Rent (including arrearages), shall become due and shall be paid up to the effective date of termination, together with such expenses, including attorneys' fees, as Landlord shall incur in connection with such termination.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item	No receipts of monies by Landlord from Tenant after termination of this Lease shall reinstate, continue, or extend the Term, affect any Notice previously given by Landlord to Tenant, or operate as a waiver of the right of Landlord to enforce the payment of Rent.

    \item	If Landlord shall terminate this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to retain, free of trust, all sums then held by Landlord pursuant to any of the provisions of this Lease, including any and all security deposits. In the interim following such termination until the retention of such sums by Landlord free of trust, such sums shall be available to Landlord, but not to Tenant, pursuant to and for the purposes provided by the terms and conditions of this Lease.

    \item	In the event of any re-entry and/or dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise without termination of this Lease:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item All Rent shall become due and shall be paid up to the time of such re-entry and/or dispossession, together with such expenses, including attorneys' fees, as Landlord shall incur in connection with such re-entry and/or dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise; and

    \item All Rent for the remainder of the Term may be accelerated and due in full, the collection of such sums being subject to the provisions of Subsection \ref{Subsection F}, below; and

    \item Landlord may relet all or any part of the Premises, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may, at Landlord's option, be equal to, less than, or greater than the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term. In connection with such reletting:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Tenant or Tenant's representative shall pay, as Additional Rent, to Landlord, as they are incurred by Landlord, such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur in connection with reletting, including, without limitation, legal expenses, attorneys' fees, brokerage commissions, and expenses incurred in altering, repairing, and putting the Premises in good order and condition and in preparing the Premises for reletting;

    \item Tenant or Tenant's representative shall pay to Landlord, in monthly installments on the due dates for Rent payments for each month of the balance of the Term, the amount by which any Rent payment exceeds the net amount, if any, of the rents for such period collected on account of the reletting of the Premises; any suit brought to collect such amount for any month or months shall not prejudice in any way the rights of Landlord to collect the deficiency for any subsequent month or months by a similar action or proceeding;

    \item At Landlord's option exercised at any time, Landlord shall be entitled to recover immediately from Tenant, in addition to any other proper claims, but in lieu of and not in addition to any amount which would thereafter become payable under the preceding subsection, a sum equal to the amount by which the sum of the Rent for the balance of the Term, compound discounted at a reasonable rate selected by Landlord to its then-present worth, exceeds the net rental value of the Premises, compound discounted at the same annual rate to its then-present worth, for the balance of the Term. In determining such net rental value of the Premises, the rent realized by any reletting of the Premises, if such reletting is upon terms (other than rental amounts) generally comparable to the terms of this Lease, shall be deemed to be such net rental value; and

    \item At Landlord's option, Landlord may make such alterations and/or decorations in or upon the Premises as Landlord, in Landlord's sole judgment, considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of reletting the Premises; the making of such alterations and/or decorations shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability under this Section; the cost of all such alterations and/or decorations shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent.

    \item  During the period of any litigation between Landlord and Tenant regarding this Lease, whether or not Tenant shall have claimed payment of Rent as a defense, Tenant shall be required to post with the Registry of the Court all past due Rent and Additional Rent as they come due.  Tenant's failure to post such Rent with the Court shall be grounds for the entry of an immediate order entitling Landlord to possession of the Premises forthwith. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \label{Subsection F}	Landlord shall have, receive, and enjoy as Landlord's sole and absolute property, any and all sums collected by Landlord as rent or otherwise upon reletting the Premises after Landlord shall resume possession of the Premises as provided by this Lease, including, without limitation, any amounts by which the sum or sums so collected shall exceed the continuing liability of Tenant under this Lease. If Landlord shall have accelerated Rent payments and collected same from Tenant, and subsequently shall have relet the Premises, then Landlord, after deducting all costs related to reletting, including, but not limited to, those described or anticipated in this Section, shall pay to Tenant the amount remaining which is collected as Rent for each month, to the extent Landlord shall have previously received the Rent for such month from Tenant.

    \item	Landlord and Tenant agree that after the commencement of suit for possession of the Premises or after final order or judgment for the possession of the Premises, Landlord may demand, receive, and collect any monies due or coming due without in any manner affecting such suit, order, or judgment. All such monies collected shall be deemed to be payments on account of the use and occupation of the Premises, or, at the election of Landlord, on account of Tenant's liability under this Lease.

    \item	The words ``re-enter'' and ``re-entry'', as used in this Section, are not and shall not be restricted to their technical legal meaning but are used in the broadest sense.

    \item	Tenant waives all rights of redemption which may otherwise be provided by any legal requirement in the event that Landlord shall, because of the occurrence of an Event of Default by Tenant, obtain possession of the Premises under legal proceedings, or pursuant to present or future law or to the terms and conditions of this Lease.

    \item	Landlord, in addition to other rights and remedies it may have, shall have the right to (a) keep in place and use all of the furniture, fixtures, and equipment in the Premises, including that which is owned by or leased to Tenant, and (b) to remove all or any part of Tenant's property from the Premises and any property removed may be sold, disposed of, or stored in any public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for	the account of Tenant. Landlord shall not be responsible for the care or safekeeping of such property, whether in transport, storage or otherwise.  Tenant waives any and all claim against Landlord for loss, destruction and/or damage or injury which may be occasioned by any of the aforesaid acts; Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for costs incurred by Landlord in connection with any storage, transport or other acts anticipated in this Section and shall hold harmless and indemnify Landlord from all loss, damage, cost, expense and liability in connection therewith. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election on Landlord's part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. Notwithstanding any such re-letting without termination, Landlord may at all times thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for such previous default. Any such re-entry shall be allowed by Tenant without hindrance, and Landlord shall not be liable in damages for any such re-entry, or guilty of trespass or forcible entry.

    \item	Landlord shall be entitled, without notice or bond, to the issuance of pre-judgment writs of replevin, pre-judgment distress writs, attachment writs, break open orders, orders authorizing the locking of the Premises to protect Landlord's lien on personal property, fixtures and equipment, and such other orders as may be issued by a court of law or equity. Landlord shall have the right to take possession as allowed under Chapter 78, Florida Statutes. The remedies described in this Section are cumulative and in addition to and without waiver of all remedies allowed Landlord by this Lease or by case law, common law and statute now or hereinafter in effect. Tenant agrees that the rights and remedies granted Landlord in this Section are commercially reasonable.

	\item	In the event Landlord initiates a commencement of suit for possession of the Premises and posts a three day notice on the Premises, Tenants shall pay Landlord a fee of \$1,000.00, which shall be immediately due and payable and shall be immediately considered additional rent and treated as such.  Said fees are not penalties, but liquidated damages to defray administrative, collection, and related expenses due to posting said three day notice.  
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Administrative Charges}
    In the event a Rent payment is not received within five (5) days after its due date, interest shall be due thereon at the rate of 18\% per annum, on the then total Rent due and unpaid. This interest shall accrue on the amount unpaid, including prior interest and administrative fees and late charges, and shall become immediately due and payable from Tenant to Landlord, without notice or demand, at the place of payment. In the event any check, bank draft or negotiable instrument given for any payment under this Lease shall be dishonored at any time for any reason whatsoever not attributable to Landlord, Landlord shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy that may be available, to an administrative charge of five percent (5\%) of the payment due. These provisions for administrative fees and late charges are not, and shall not be deemed, grace periods. Such administrative fees and late charges are not penalties, but liquidated damages to defray administrative, collection, and related expenses due to Tenant's failure to make such Rent payment when due or failure to process the dishonored instrument. An additional administrative fee and late charge shall become immediately due and payable on the first day of each month for which all or a portion of a Rent payment (together with any administrative fee and late charge) remains unpaid, and for each dishonored instrument. Any and all charges due under this Lease shall be deemed additional rent immediately upon coming due and shall be treated as additional rent for all purposes. 

\section{Lien for Payment of Rent}
    Landlord shall have, and Tenant grants to Landlord, a security interest in any furnishings, equipment, fixtures, inventory, and other personal property of any kind belonging to Tenant, or the equity of Tenant in such items, on the Premises or elsewhere (to the extent that such property is owned by Tenant). No lien rights shall extend to any personal property owned by any employee, officer or director of Tenant that may be located on the Premises. Such security interest is granted for the purposes of securing the payment of Rent and other charges, assessments, penalties, and damages required under this Lease to be paid by Tenant, and of securing the performance of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Upon Tenant's default or breach of any terms and conditions of this Lease, Landlord shall have all remedies available under applicable law, equity or as provided in this Lease including without limitation, the right to take possession of any or all of the items referred to in this Section and dispose of them by public or private sale in a commercially reasonable manner. Landlord shall also have the right to relinquish possession of all or any portion of such furniture, fixtures, equipment and other property to any person (``Claimant'') claiming to be entitled to possession thereof who presents to Landlord a copy of any instruments represented to Landlord by Claimant to have been executed by Tenant (or any predecessor of Tenant) granting Claimant the right under various circumstances to take possession of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or other property, without the necessity on the part of Landlord to inquire into the authenticity of said instrument's copy of Tenant's or Tenant's predecessor's signature thereon and without the necessity of Landlord making any nature of investigation or inquiry as to the validity of the factual or legal basis upon which Claimant purports to act; and Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from all cost, expense, loss, damage and liability incident to Landlord's relinquishment of possession of all or any portion of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or other property to Claimant. The provision for a landlord's lien as described in this Article shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any landlord's lien and similar remedies otherwise provided by statutory or common law.

    To the extent, if any, that this Lease grants Landlord any lien or lien rights greater than provided by the laws of the State of Florida pertaining to landlords' liens, this Lease is intended as and constitutes a security agreement within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code. Landlord, in addition to the rights prescribed in this Lease, shall have a Security Interest, as that term is defined under this state's Uniform Commercial Code, in the items referred to in this Section to secure the payment to Landlord of the various amounts provided for in this Lease. Tenant agrees to and shall execute and deliver to Landlord such financing statements and such further assurances as Landlord may, from time to time, consider necessary to create, perfect, and preserve the lien described and all additional substitutions, replacements, and accessions thereto, and all proceeds of its or their sale or the disposition (under the Uniform Commercial Code, other statutory provisions, or otherwise). Landlord, at the expense of Tenant, may cause such financing statements and assurances to be recorded and re-recorded, filed and re-filed, and renewed or continued, at such times and places as may be required or permitted by law to create, perfect, and preserve such items. In the event Tenant fails to promptly execute and return to Landlord such financing statements and other instruments as Landlord may require to create, preserve, and perfect its lien, Tenant shall and does hereby designate Landlord to act as Tenant's agent and attorney in fact for the sole and limited purpose of executing such financing statements and other instruments and any such execution by Landlord pursuant to this Lease shall be effective and binding upon Tenant as though executed originally by Tenant, such designation being a power coupled with an interest which gives full power and authority to execute and deliver the designated documentation on behalf of Landlord and which is a material inducement to Landlord to enter into this Lease. Tenant's designation of Landlord as agent and attorney-in-fact hereunder shall not be subject to revocation until this Lease is terminated.


\section{Waiver of Default}
    Failure of Landlord to declare any default immediately upon occurrence thereof, or delay in taking any action in connection therewith, shall not waive such default, but Landlord shall have the right to declare any such default at any time and take such action as might be lawful or authorized hereunder, in law and/or in equity. No waiver by Landlord of a default by Tenant shall be implied, and no express waiver by landlord shall affect any default other than the default specified in such waiver and that only for the time and extension therein stated.

    No waiver of any term, provision, condition or covenant of this Lease by Landlord shall be deemed to imply or constitute a further waiver by Landlord of any other term, provision, condition or covenant of this Lease. In addition to any rights and remedies specifically granted Landlord herein, Landlord shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law and in equity, whether existing at time of execution or of enforcement of this Lease, in the event that Tenant shall fail to perform any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be performed or fails to pay Base Rent, Additional Rent or any other sums due Landlord when due. All rights and remedies specifically granted to Landlord herein, by law and in equity shall be cumulative and not mutually exclusive.



\section{Right of Entry}
    Landlord, or any of its agents, shall have the right to enter the Premises during all reasonable hours to examine the same or to make such repairs, additions or alterations as may be deemed necessary for the safety, comfort, or preservation thereof, or to said Plaza, or to exhibit said Premises at any time within one hundred fifty (150) days before the expiration of this Lease. Landlord shall provide Tenant with prior notice and agrees to use its efforts not to interfere with daily business operations. Said right of entry shall likewise exist for the purpose of removing placards, signs, fixtures, alterations, or additions which do not conform to this Lease.


\section{Notice}
    Any notice given Landlord as provided for in this Lease shall be sent to Landlord by certified mail addressed to Landlord at \corpaddress{} or any other address the landlords. Any notice to be given Tenant under the terms of this Lease, including the statutory three (3) day notice for evictions, unless otherwise stated herein, shall be in writing and shall be sent via electronic mail to tenant at \href{mailto:\noticeemail}{\noticeemail{}} or shall be personally delivered or sent by registered mail or by nationally (U.S.) recognized overnight delivery service to Tenant at the Premises or any other method wherein it can be reasonably determined that Tenant received the notice. The statutory three (3) day notice may also be posted at the Premises.  Said posting of the statutory three (3) day notice at the Premises shall be considered valid service of the three (3) day notice.

    The undersigned shall not be discharged in any way hereunder on the ground that any or all such obligations of Tenant may be void or voidable in respect to Tenant because of the absence of authority of any agent, or, of any officer partner, member or other party purporting to act on behalf of Tenant, or because of the want of capacity on the part of Tenant to incur such obligations, whether such incapacity results from infancy, coverture, lack of corporate power, mental condition or any other cause whatsoever.  No action taken by Landlord to enforce the liability of or the acceptance of anything of value in payment or satisfaction of liability or the complete or partial release of the liability of any one or more of the undersigned or any other guarantor shall release or impair the liability of the remaining undersigned or any other guarantor.

    This Guaranty shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Florida and venue shall be in \county {} County, Florida.
